# TransactionService Implementation

## Overview

The TransactionService is a core component of the Super Ghana application, responsible for handling all financial transactions including transfers, deposits, withdrawals, payments, loan disbursements, and loan repayments. This service is designed to ensure transaction integrity, security, and auditability.

## Key Features

1. **Result Object Pattern**: All methods return a standardized Result object with success/failure status and data/error information
2. **Transaction Isolation**: All database operations use proper transaction isolation to prevent race conditions
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting and logging for all transaction outcomes
4. **Security Integration**: Built-in security checks and audit trail tracking
5. **Concurrency Protection**: Pessimistic locking for critical operations to prevent race conditions

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Transfer Transaction

```ruby
result = TransactionService.create_transfer(
  source_wallet: user.wallet,
  destination_wallet: recipient.wallet,
  amount: 100.00,
  description: "Payment for services"
)

if result.success?
  transaction = result.data[:transaction]
  # Process the transaction or show confirmation
else
  # Handle errors
  error_message = result.error[:message]
  error_code = result.error[:code]
end
```

### Processing a Transaction

```ruby
service = TransactionService.new(
  transaction,
  current_user,
  request.remote_ip,
  request.user_agent
)

result = service.process(
  external_reference: external_reference,
  verification_data: verification_data
)

if result.success?
  # Transaction processed successfully
  transaction = result.data[:transaction]
else
  # Handle failure
  error_message = result.error[:message]
  error_code = result.error[:code]
end
```

## Error Handling

The service uses a standardized error reporting mechanism with descriptive codes and messages. Common error codes include:

- `:insufficient_funds` - Source wallet has insufficient balance
- `:inactive_wallet` - Wallet is not in an active state
- `:security_check_failed` - Transaction failed security validation
- `:processor_failed` - External payment processor reported failure
- `:completion_failed` - Transaction could not be completed
- `:invalid_amount` - Transaction amount is invalid (zero or negative)
- `:not_found` - Transaction or resource not found

## Transaction Isolation

The service implements proper database isolation to handle concurrent transactions:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(isolation: :serializable) do
  # Transaction operations
end
```

Additionally, pessimistic locking is used for critical operations:

```ruby
wallet = transaction.source_wallet.reload.lock!
```

## Security Considerations

The service integrates with the application's security framework:

1. **Transaction Security Checks**: Each transaction undergoes security verification
2. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for auditability
3. **Fraud Detection**: Integration with security monitoring services
4. **Error Reporting**: Critical issues are properly logged and reported

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are included to verify all aspects of the service:

- Unit tests for each transaction type
- Test cases for success and failure scenarios
- Edge case testing for concurrent operations
- Security check verification

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the Result object**: Check the success status before accessing data
2. **Handle all error codes**: Implement appropriate responses for each error type
3. **Use proper database transactions**: Ensure database consistency
4. **Log critical errors**: Monitor and alert on critical transaction failures
5. **Validate inputs**: Ensure all parameters are valid before processing
